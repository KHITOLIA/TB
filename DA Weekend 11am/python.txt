Machine learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computer systems to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks over time without being explicitly programmed for every instruction. It involves using algorithms to find patterns in large datasets, which allows systems to make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. Key applications include tasks like image analysis, predictive forecasting, and powering virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
